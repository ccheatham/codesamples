		We have had the pleasure of being involved in over a dozen homes in the beautiful town of Rosemary Beach, Florida.  One of the first we designed, a weekend house for Birmingham, Alabama interior designer Betsy Brown is featured in the May 2004 issue of <b>House Beautiful</b> magazine.  See this special home in the article entitled <b><a href="gallery.cfm?pubID=109">"Beach Chic"</a></b>.</p>
		<p>For the fourth year in a row we are pleased to be included in <b>House Beautiful Magazine's</b> directory in their November 2004 issue which lists the top designers in America. </p>
		
		<p>Looking for a McAlpine House?  A<a href="http://www.mcalpinetankersley.com/gallery.cfm?pubID=29" target="_blank"> beautiful lake front home</a> in Charlotte, North Carolina is available.  Call Micki Fisher at 704-377-9000. </p>

		Over the years we&#39;ve had the distinct pleasure to work with Interior 
		Decorator Cindy Smith from Charlotte and Landscape Architect Ben Page 
		from Nashville.  Our latest collaboration is spotlighted in the 
		March-April 2004 issue of <b>Southern Accents</b>.  The Memphis, Tennessee home 
		is featured in the article <b><a href="gallery.cfm?pubID=108">&#8220;Rules of Engagement&#8221;</a></b>.
		</p>
		
		
		
		 <p><b>Southern Accents</b> magazine spotlights Bobby in their continuing series <b><a href="gallery.cfm?pubID=106">&#8220;Masters of the House&#8221;</a></b> in the November-December 2003 issue.  This continuing series features nationally recognized residential architects. </p>
		<p>In addition to his architectural and interiors work, Bobby McAlpine has created an new upholstered furniture line. <em>McAlpine Home</em> is featured in <b><a href="gallery.cfm?pubID=105">&#8220;Right at Home&#8221;</a></b> in the March-April 2003 edition of <b>Southern Accents</b>. </p>
		<p>Bobby McAlpine likes to experiment on interiors on his personal home.  
 Case in point is the third incarnation of his Montgomery, Alabama 
residence.  View the latest (and most somber) interior of this house in 
 <b><a href="gallery.cfm?pubID=104">&#8220;Adroit Articulated&#8221;</a></b> in the March-April 2003 issue of <b>Veranda</b>.
 </p>
		<p>British House and Garden's January 2003 issue boasts the article <a href="gallery.cfm?pubID=103">&#8220;American Classic&#8221;</a>.  Once again, photographs of the Nashville home of Patrick and Stephanie Maxwell are gracing a magazine.  As if that wasn't enough, the Maxwell's living room can also be seen in <b>Veranda</b> magazine's <em>Last Impressions</em> page in their February 2003 publication.  The dramatic interiors of this breathtaking home were accomplished by <a href="http://www.mcalpineboothferrier.com">McAlpine Booth and Ferrier Interiors</a>. </p>
		<p>The Institute of Classical Architecture, in celebration of its 10th 
anniversary, has included two of our projects (the Maxwell house, 
Nashville, Tennessee and the Richardson house, Charlotte, North 
Carolina) in their new book <b>&#8220;The Classicist&#8221;</b>.  The published projects 
were selected from architectural submissions from all over the United 
States.  We are very honored to be included in their continued studies 
of classical architecture.</p></td>
